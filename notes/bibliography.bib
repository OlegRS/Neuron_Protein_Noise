abstract = {Gene expression is an inherently stochastic process: Genes are activated and inactivated by random association and dissociation events, transcription is typically rare, and many proteins are present in low numbers per cell. The last few years have seen an explosion in the stochastic modeling of these processes, predicting protein fluctuations in terms of the frequencies of the probabilistic events. Here I discuss commonalities between theoretical descriptions, focusing on a gene-mRNA-protein model that includes most published studies as special cases. I also show how expression bursts can be explained as simplistic time-averaging, and how generic approximations can allow for concrete interpretations without requiring concrete assumptions. Measures and nomenclature are discussed to some extent and the modeling literature is briefly reviewed.}

	Abstract = {Proteins drive the function of neuronal synapses. The synapses are distributed throughout the dendritic arbor, often hundreds of micrometers away from the soma. It is still unclear how somatic and dendritic sources of proteins shape protein distribution and respectively contribute to local protein changes during synaptic plasticity. Here, we present a unique computational framework describing for a given protein species the dendritic distribution of the mRNA and the corresponding protein in a dendrite. Using CaMKIIα as a test case, our model reveals the key role active transport plays in the maintenance of dendritic mRNA and protein levels and predicts the short and long timescales of protein dynamics. Our model reveals the fundamental role of mRNA localization and dendritic mRNA translation in synaptic maintenance and plasticity in distal compartments. We developed a web application for neuroscientists to explore the dynamics of the mRNA or protein of interest.},
